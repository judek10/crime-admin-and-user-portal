## Topics Discussed
- Showed our mentor our progress so far.
- We asked for our mentor's advice on how to work with the database.
- Our mentor provided us with a list of what our next steps should be: 
  - Make a back-end repository and create an endpoint/controller so that our front-end can make API calls to the back-end for data.
  - Connect and read from database using node.
  - Make a service class in our front-end to make API calls to the back-end.
  - Make a local copy of database so that we can read/write from it.
- Discussed with the group what can realistically be done with the current timeline.
- We decided that making a backend repository is too time-consuming given the current deadline, so that's moved to next iteration.
- For the app's first iteration functionality, we decided that we'll use local storage instead of DB to store data.

## Things Clarified
- Clarified the plan to finish the first iteration with one another.
- Clarified the next steps with our mentor.
