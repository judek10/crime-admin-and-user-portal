## Topics Discussed
- We showed off our project so far and what we have done.
- Casey gave us feedback and explained what he thought we should do to be on track for the deadline.
- Casey also looked over our documentation page, and gave us a good idea how we should set up our manual for the front end and back end. 
- Casey told us that if our client cannot give us permissions to be able to read/write to DB, then to mock the DB on our own to stay on track.

## Things Clarified
- Clarified what was left for us to do to stay on track for the deadline.
- Clarified that we can stay on track by creating our own DB to replicate the client's if needed.
