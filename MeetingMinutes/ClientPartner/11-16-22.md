## Topics Discussed
- Asked about going through the steps for Cognito and AWS services, as well as the functions themselves.
- Though we were unable to get a showcase through Zoom at this time due to Blaine's computer being difficult,
the suggestion of using Windows' step recorder to record things whenever possible, was given to replicate the process.
- Talked about the connection to the database and endpoints, and what could be done there.

## Things Clarified
- Clarified the need to get the connections up and going on what we have, even if only Read-only.
- Clarified that we might need to delegate tasks for the workload going further.
- Clarified usage of the AWS services and Postgres, where Postgres data currently is needing to be used.
