## Topics Discussed
  - We showed off our project so far and what we have done.
  - We showed off our documentation.md as well. 
  - Discussed second iteration.
  - Blaine reviewed our project, and basically just gave us pointers to think about in later iterations. For example, he said later on, he would want to be able to click an organization and see inside of it different things like users, etc. 
  - Thought documention.md file looked good.
  - Discussed meeting next week to walk through his AWS Cognito as well as looking at 

## Things Clarified
  - Clarified with Blaine that next iteration we want to actually reach out to a database and not just have local stuff. 
  - Clarified that we need to set time next week for a meeting to review how his AWS Cognito works for user authentication. 
  - Clarified if we ever run into a wall, to get into contact with him so we can figure out an easier solution for all of us.
