## Topics Discussed
- We showed off our project and what we have done.
- We displayed how our front end talks to a database that's connected to our backend, which stores organizations and users.
- Discussed ways we did certain things pertaining to the code. 
- Blaine gave some helpful feedback on a library we could use called "Ngx Datatable", which would hold all the data in a formatted table instead of manually doing it all.
- Blaine gave us an idea about blurring out a submit button until all fields were filled in when creating a user.

## Things Clarified
- Clarified where we were at with the project and potential next steps to get deeper involved. 
- Clarified Ngx datatable by showing example code he had already in use.
