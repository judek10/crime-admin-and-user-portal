# Things clarified
We clarified that we wanted to get the Integrate Linter assignment done, and that we should meet up in person to review the project before the iteration review comes up.

## Topics Discussed
We discussed and went over the Integrate Linter assignment on canvas, and ran lint on both the front and back end of the project, looking over the errors that had shown up. Lastly, we discussed possible solutions for showing organization metrics, which is a work in progress.
