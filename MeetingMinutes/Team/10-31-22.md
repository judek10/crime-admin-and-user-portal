## Topics Discussed
We worked on trying to get a connection from our laptops to pgAdmin, so we could connect to the database links that were given to us by Blaine. There was trouble doing so, so we got in contact with Blaine, and have a meeting set up for tomorrow, 11/1 to figure out the issues. We the discussed trying to get as much of the UI done as possible, so we can maximize our work with what we are capable of doing at the moment. 

## Things Clarified
We clarified that we need to meet with Blaine, and set up a time which is convenient for all. We also clarified that we could all make branches and work on the UI. This helps give everyone a chance to get familiar with this aspect, as well as give us 5 possible looks for our "God Mode" part of the software.
