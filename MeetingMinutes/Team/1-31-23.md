# Things clarified
The team clarified the need to get more information about items from the client and our mentor, such as criteria to be met and stylistic/general items respectively. As well as the work on the user organization and admin metrics for further progress.

## Topics Discussed
The team discussed that we needed to contact our client in order to figure out what they want when it comes to their criteria of "Most hit terms" in the user metrics. While doing so, we also asked to set up a meeting to showcase what we had for the client meeting assignment. Subsequently, we asked our mentor for a meeting to go over things before the client meeting.
