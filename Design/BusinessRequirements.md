## Business Requirements

* BR1- We need to be able to manage over the software directly as an administration. 
  * This is one of the business requirements due to its overall necessity. The software itself needs to have a way where the main admin can directly go into the software and move around. This will benefit the business by making it easier for the admin to maneuver around and perform functions without manually doing it in the back end. 

* BR2- We need to allow businesses to assign super admins with permissions to manage their organization.
