## Business Requirements

* BR1- We need to be able to manage over the software directly as an administration. 
  * This is one of the business requirements due to its overall necessity. The software itself needs to have a way where the main admin can directly go into the software and move around. This will benefit the business by making it extremely easier for the admin to maneuver around and perform functions without manually doing it in the back end. 


* BR2- We need to allow the businesses to manage over employees using CrimeMiner to add or remove users. 
  * This business requirement also uses automation to cut out contacting the developers. This is a requirement because it allows the businesses who subscribe to CrimeMiner the ability to manage the users in their departments.


* BR3 - We need to allow admins the ability to manage login information as well as view usage metrics. 
  * This business requirement is to allow admins to be able to view and change login information of users within their organization. As well as to allow admins to see the usage metrics of users within their organization.
