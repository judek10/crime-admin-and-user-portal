## Business Requirements
* BR1 - Save time and improve the user experience using automation for the analytics and reports - 
  * This is one of the business requirements due to its overall importance related to our project's goals. Everything which we are planning to do relates to this development of automation, as well as the benefits it will provide for the company. In our initial client meeting we were told how this was the general aim for the project, and that we should put our focus into it's functionality first and foremost. Therefore, this is our first business requirement.


* BR2- We need to be able to manage over the software directly as an administration. 
  * This is one of the business requirements due to its overall necessity. The software itself needs to have a way where the main admin can directly go into the software and move around. This will benefit the business by making it extremely easier for the admin to maneuver around and perform functions without manually doing it in the back end. 


* BR3- We need to allow the businesses to manage over employees using CrimeMiner to add or remove users. 
  * This business requirement also uses automation to cut out contacting the developers. This is a requirement because it allows the businesses who subscribe to CrimeMiner the ability to manage the users in their departments.


* BR4 - We need to allow users the ability to manage login information as well as view usage metrics.
