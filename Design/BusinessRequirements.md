## Business Requirements

* BR1- We need to be able to manage over the software directly as an administration. 
  * This is one of the business requirements due to its overall necessity. The software itself needs to have a way where the main admin can directly go into the software and move around. This will benefit the business by making it extremely easier for the admin to maneuver around and perform functions without manually doing it in the back end. 


* BR2- We need to allow the businesses to manage over employees using CrimeMiner to add or remove users. 
  * This business requirement also uses automation to cut out contacting the developers. This is a requirement because it allows the businesses who subscribe to CrimeMiner the ability to manage the users in their departments.


* BR3 - We need to allow users the ability to manage login information.
  * This business requirement is to allow all users to manage their login information. They should be able to change or reset their passwords. This is a requirement because it allows users to have full controll over their indvidual account.

* BR4 - We need to allow Admins to see crime miner usage data.
  * This business requirement is to allow Admins to be able to see the usage rate of the crime miner liscenes within their organizations. This allows for administrators of organizations to make educated descisions about their crime miner liscenses.
